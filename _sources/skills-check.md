# Skills Check

This course assumes knowledge of the topics and skills below. Although you may not have experience with every single one of these, we expect that by satisfying the prerequisites, you can self-learn whatever you're missing prior to the start of the course. Please take a moment to review the topics below.


## Coding

**Programming Language.** The course is taught entirely in Python. To get the most out of the course, it's important you don't feel bogged down by too many syntax errors and the like so that you can focus on the concepts we introduce. If you do not feel comfortable with Python, that's no problem. Please do take the time before the start of the course to *study and practice* it. For review, we recommend:
* Going through an online Python tutorial. For example, from this [interactive Python tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/), review all sections under "Learn the Basics" and "Data Science Tutorials." From the "Advanced Tutorials," review "List Comprehensions" and "Lambda functions."
* After completing the tutorial, select one or two assignments from CS230 and translate them into Python.

**Integrated Development Environments (IDE).** We will be using [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/) for all assignments in the course. DeepNote is an interactive Python environment that makes it easy to write code in small pieces, and to visualize and inspect them. Further, it let's you interleave your code with notes and math. If you're familiar with Jupyter notebooks, they are just a cloud version of a Jupyter notebook. If this is new to you, no problem! To get you started, we recommend:
* Making an account on the DeepNote website, creating a "notebook" and playing around.
* Watching/reading some online tutorials, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW4lKlUnLGU). 


**Libraries.** We will regularly use two Python libraries throughout the course: `pandas`, used for reading in `.csv` data files and manipulating them, and `matplotlib`, used for visualizations.
* To learn `pandas`, you can find lots of tutorials online. For example you may find the first two lessons from [this tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) helpful.
* Similarly, [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_getting_started.asp) will walk you through how to use `matplotlib.




## Math

TODO:
* sums and products
* logs
* derivatives (univariate)
* integrals (univariate)
* limits


## LaTeX



## Probability and Statistics 

Although the course introduces a *probabilistic* paradigm of ML, we do not assume *any* prior knowledge of probability and statistics. All necessary topics from these subjects will be introduced as needed in the course.
