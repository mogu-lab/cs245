## Eugenics and the Birth of Modern Statistics


````{admonition} Exercise: Background on Eugenics and Statistics
**Part 1:** Read, *[Eugenics and Scientific Racism](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Eugenics-and-Scientific-Racism)*.
* What was the goal of eugenics / scientific racism?
* What form did eugenics take in the US? In Nazi Germany?
* Who was leading the eugenics movement?

**Part 2:** From, *[The Mismeasure of Man](http://tankona.free.fr/gould1981.pdf)*, read "The allure of numbers" and "Masters of craniometry: Paul Broca and his school" from Chapter 3 (trigger warning: offensive, discriminatory language). 
* What's the "allure of numbers"?
* What does the author mean by "Science is rooted in creative interpretation"? Provide an example (of the "numbers," interpretation, and theory). 
* What were some of the things Francis Galton quantified? What are some fallacies of conclusions he might draw from his data?
* What's "craniometry"? 
* What happened when Mall tried to replicate Bean's findings? 
* What were the fallacies of Broca's scientific methods?

**Part 3:** Read, *[How Eugenics Shaped Statistics](https://nautil.us/how-eugenics-shaped-statistics-238014/)*. 
* Who were Galton, Pearon, and Fisher?

## Is Eugenics *just* bad science?

**Part 2:** Read, *[Do artifacts have politics?](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/Winner.pdf)*
* TODO

**Part 3:** Many of the techniques introduced in this class were created by leaders of the eugenics movement. For example, the MLE was proposed by Fisher in *[On an Absolute Criterion for Fitting Frequency Curves](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2246266)*. Factor Analysis was proposed by Burt in *[Experimental Tests of General Intelligence](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1909.tb00197.x)*, and later [refined by Spearman](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Charles-Spearman%2C-Cyril-Burt%2C-and-the-origins-of-Lovie-Lovie/b4f2fe99f093d7dce355b3a1aff15889b0e364c3). Linear regression was proposed by Fisher in *[The Goodness of Fit of Regression Formulae, and the Distribution of Regression Coefficients](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2341124)*. And correlation was proposed by Galton in *[Co-Relations and Their Measurement, Chiefly from Anthropometric Data](https://www.jstor.org/stable/114860)*.
