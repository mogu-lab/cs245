    "**Context:** For safety-critical applications of ML, it's important that our model captures two notions of uncertainty. Aleatoric uncertainty captures inherent stochasticity in the system. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty is uncertainty over possible *models* that could have fit the data. Multiple models can fit the data when we have a lack of data and/or a lack of mechanistic understanding of the system. We realized that fitting models using the MLE only captured aleatoric uncertainty. To additionally capture epistemic, we therefore had to rethink our modeling paradigm. Using Bayes' rule, we were able to obtain a *distribution* over model parameters given the data, $p(\\theta | \\mathcal{D})$ (the posterior). Using `NumPyro`, we sampled from the posterior to obtain a diversity of models that fit the data. We interpreted a greater diversity of models indicated higher epistemic ucnertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** Now that we have a posterior over model parameters, we can capture *epistemic* uncertainty. But how do we use this diverse set of models to (1) make predictions, and (2) compute the log-likelihood (for evaluation)? To do this, we will derive the *posterior predictive*, a distribution that translates a distribution over parameters to a distribution over data. This distributions can then be used to make predictions and evaluate the log-likelihood.\n",

    "**Bayesian Modeling as Ensembling.** Recall in the previous chapter, we initially introduced *ensembling* as a way to capture epistemic uncertainty. In ensembling, we train a collection of models independently and hope that, due to quirks in optimization, we end up with a diverse collection of models. In a sense, doesn't our Bayesian approach provide us with an ensemble as well? After all, each set of parameters $\\theta$ from the posterior $p(\\theta | \\mathcal{D})$ represents a different model. Based on this analogy, we can create a \"Bayesian\" ensemble as follows:\n",
    "1. We draw $S$ samples from the posterior: $\\theta_s \\sim p(\\theta | \\mathcal{D})$. \n",
    "2. Each posterior sample represents a different member of our ensemble: $p(\\mathcal{D} | \\theta_s)$.\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Next, we use the law of total probability to re-write the above as a joint distribution over $\\mathcal{D}^*$, $\\mathcal{D}$, and $\\theta$. We do this to introduce $\\theta$ into the equation---since our model's prior, likelihood, and posterior all depend on $\\theta$, it would be weird if the formula for $p(\\mathcal{D}^* | \\mathcal{D})$ didn't depend on it. This gives us:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "&= \\frac{\\int p(\\mathcal{D}^*, \\mathcal{D}, \\theta) \\cdot d\\theta}{p(\\mathcal{D})} \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Now, we can factorize this joint distribution to get one term that's the posterior, $p(\\theta | \\mathcal{D})$, and one term that's the marginal, $p(\\mathcal{D})$:\n",

    "Finally, using the laws of conditional independence, we know that $p(\\mathcal{D}^* | \\theta, \\mathcal{D}) = p(\\mathcal{D}^* | \\theta)$.

In other words, $\\theta$ summarizes all information from $\\mathcal{D}$ needed to predict $\\mathcal{D}^*$ (we cover the laws of conditional independence in depth below). This gives us the following equation:\n",

    "&= \\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta | \\mathcal{D})} \\left[ p(\\mathcal{D}^* | \\theta) \\right]\n",

    "**Motivation.** Recall in a linear regression model, we often sample the slope and intercept independently under the prior. For example, we may choose to draw each from a normal distribution (with no correlations). However, when we condition on data (i.e. under the posterior), they are no longer independent. Why does this happen? To fit the data, if the slope increases, the intercept has to decrease (and vice versa). Generalizing this insight, when conditioning on a variable, we need to rethink the statistical dependence. This becomes important when deriving distributions like the posterior predictive. \n",

In a CBM, a concept is just a discrete attribute associated with the input; for example, if $x_n$ is an image of wildlife, a concept could be rain, grass, dog, etc. You can think of $p_{C | X}$ as a classifier. \n",
