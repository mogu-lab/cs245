## About the Course Staff


We're here because we care. So what does that mean? It means that...

**We want you to find meaning in the course, and we want you succeed.** TODO.

**We want you to come to our office hours.** We want to get to know you all, both in the context of the class and as individuals â€“ we want to know what research you're working on, what you do for fun, what you're finding most challenging in the program, what you find most rewarding, etc. This is one aspect of the course we enjoy most.

**We want to see you _even more_ when you're struggling, lost, or down.** You may be surprised to know that as course staff, we still vividly remember our struggle learning the material covered by this course. We recognize that there are "good" types of struggle---struggle that builds you up and helps you grow---as well as "bad" types of struggle---struggle---that doesn't leads you to question your self-worth, and that makes you want to give up. When things get hard, the worst thing you can do is isolate yourself, and the best thing you can do is to come talk to us. We can, together, find ways to productively deal with both the good and the bad.

**We have high expectations for you to be thoughtful and engaged.** We expect you to be thoughtful in your engagement with the course materials and in your interaction with your peers. Substantial amounts of research have shown that [Computer Science programs can create cultures of isolation and impostorism](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse590e/02sp/defensive_20climate.pdf), in which students feel judged for common struggles many experience, instead of coming together to support one another. We ask you to be thoughtful in how you validate your peer's identities and create a safe and supportive space for everyone.

## Classroom Environment


**Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI):** It is the mission of the teaching staff that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. We aim to create a learning environment that is inclusive and respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions for how to better our classroom community are always encouraged and appreciated.

Since a large part of this course requires students to work in groups, in alignment with our teaching mission, we ask that students explicitly reflect on and implement practices for building teams that are diverse along many axes. The teaching staff is happy to help you brainstorm how to create an inclusive and productive working culture for your team.
