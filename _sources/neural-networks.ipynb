    "**Context:** So far, we've focused on translating our IHH colleague's goals into probabilistic models, and then fitting these models to data to help them answer scientific questions. In each model's conditional distributions, we've had to make two choices: what distribution to use, and how the distributions parameter should depend on the condition. For example, in regression, recall we picked the following conditional distribution:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p_{Y | X}(\\cdot | x_n; \\underbrace{W, \\sigma}_{\\theta}) = \\mathcal{N}( \\underbrace{\\mu(x_n; W)}_{\\text{trend}}, \\underbrace{\\sigma^2}_{\\text{noise}} ),\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\mu(x_n; W)$ represents the \"trend\" of the data. We've had to decide whether $\\mu(x_n; W)$ should be linear, polynomial, or some other function. As our data grows in complexity---for example, as $x_n$ becomes high-dimensional---it becomes increasingly difficult to make up functions that are, expressive, fast, and easy to code. We will show you why below. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** So what functions should be use in our probabilistic models? Here, we will introduce a new type of function---a *neural network*. As we will show here, neural networks are expressive, fast, and easy to code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Outline:** \n",
    "* Shortcomings of other expressive functions, likely polynomials\n",
    "* The idea behind neural networks: using function composition to create expressive functions\n",
    "* Introduce *a little bit* of linear algebra to help introduce neural networks\n",
    "* Introduce neural networks, implement them in `NumPyro` and fit them to IHH data\n",
    "* Connect the math behind neural networks to the pictures used to represent them in popular media"
