    "**Context:** So far, you've spent some time conducting a preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) of IHH's ER data. You noticed that considering variables separately can result in misleading information. As a result, you decided to use *conditional distributions* to model the *relationship between variables*. Using these conditional distributions, you were able to develop *predictive models* (e.g. predicting the probability of intoxication given the day of the week). These predictive models are useful for the IHH administration to make decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, you've noticed that your modeling toolkit is still limited. The conditional distributions we introduced can model how the probability of one variable changes given a *set* of variables. What if we wanted to describe how the probability of a *set* of variables (i.e. more than one) changes given a *set* of variables? For example, we may want to answer questions like: \"how does the probability that a patient is hospitalized for an allergic reaction change given the day of the week?\" In this question, we're inquiring about two variables---that the condition is an allergic reaction, *and* that the patient was hospitalized---given the day of the week.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Part 1:** Use what you already know about the marginal and conditional distributions of the IHH ER data, in tandem with what you learned here about joint distributions to implement this generative model. Implement your model as a function that takes in a random generator `key` and outputs a Python dictionary with a single sample from the joint distribution $p_{D, C, H, K, A}(\\cdot)$. That is, the dictionary has keys $D$, $C$, $H$, $K$, and $A$, with values corresponding to the sample. Your function should rely on your previous implementations of the conditional distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2:** Implement a second function that, given $D = d$, $C = c$, $H = h$, $K = k$, and $A = a$, computes the log probability of the joint, $\\log p_{D, C, H, K, A}(d, c, h, k, a)$. Your function should rely on your previous implementations of the conditional distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: $\\log (X \\cdot Y) = \\log X + \\log Y$*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3:** Draw 10,000 samples from the generative model, and evaluate the model's log probability on each. Of all the samples you drew, print out the sample with the *highest* and *lowest* log probability. What does each tell you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You're welcome to use a loop for this problem (we'll learn how to vectorize sampling in the next chapter).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** `NumPyro` discrete distributions only work with integers, not strings. For example, instead of using $d = \\text{Monday}$, you should convert the days of the week into integers from 0 to 6 (Monday to Sunday), and instead use $d = 0$ for \"Monday\". We've created two helper functions to help you with this conversion: `convert_day_of_week_to_int` and `convert_condition_to_int`. You can use them as follows:\n",
    "  * `convert_day_of_week_to_int(data['Day-of-Week'])`\n",
    "  * `convert_condition_to_int(data['Condition'])`\n",
