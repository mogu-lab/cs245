    "**Challenge:** So what stands in our way of applying our modeling tools to real-world data? First, we've only instantiated our models with *discrete* distributions. Many real-world data, however, requires *continuous* distributions; that is, distributions over real numbers (e.g. blood pressure, body-mass index, time spent in REM sleep, etc.). We'll get more into the details of continuous modeling a bit later. Our second obstacle is: we still don't have a way of *automatically* fitting a model to data. So far, you've fit all models to data by hand via inspection---you looked at the data and tried to match the model to the data. With increasing model and data complexity, it becomes prohibitively difficult to fit the model to the data by hand. Today, we'll introduce one technique for doing this: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This is the first algorithm we cover that allows the machine to \"learn\" from data.\n",

As such, we will not get into the nitty gritty of how models are fit to data. Nonetheless, it is important to informally highlight several theoretical properties of the MLE. The purpose of this is to help us understand, what can we expect of the MLE---will it behave like we want in different situations?\n",

For each of the data sets, suppose we were to then fit the same model and obtain $\\theta^\\text{learned}$. For an unbiased learning algorithm, averaging all of the $\\theta^\\text{learned}$'s would yield $\\theta^\\text{true}$.\n",

Would you want to use a learning algorithm that, with more data, becomes more and more wrong? Unbiasedness and low-variance, together, give us a notion of how *quickly* our learning algorithm converges to the true parameters with more data. These two often come at a tradeoff with one another.
