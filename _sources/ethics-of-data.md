# The Ethics of Data

**Context:** So far, we've been giving data from our collaborators and we've done our best to help answer their scientific questions. Without much reflection, we can easily conclude that we've done "good" in the world; after all, we've just doing our best to improve patient care for beings across the galaxy. But is this the limit to our role in our IHH? Or are we also responsible for asking the "bigger questions"---to question our professional role from an ethical perspective? 

**Challenge:** One challenge we may have is that we don't even know what we should ask ourselves. This is where our colleagues who study gender and critical race theory, anthropology, philosophy, science and technology studies, the history of science, and more, can offer us invaluable perspectives. 

**Outline:** We'll focus on three questions:
* What's lost when we represent people as data?
* Is data neutral?
* How do we responsibly collect and use data?

All three questions are fundementally concerned with *representation*. Data offers us a representation of people. Models offer us a representation of people, as well as of our *assumptions*. This is exactly what we've been concerned with so far! And as the readings below will argue, these representations are shaped by implicit and explicit societal values. For us to act responsibly and ethically, we must therefore interrogate them. 


## What's lost when we represent people as data?


````{admonition} Exercise: Ethics of Representation
**Part 1:** From the book, *Data Feminism*, read *[Chapter 4: "What Gets Counted Counts"](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/h1w0nbqp/release/3)*.
* According to the author, what differentiates "data" from "information"? 
* What do we gain, and what do we lose when we turn information into data? 
* What is the "paradox of exposure"? 
* What does the author mean by "counting as healing/accountability"? 

**Part 2:** Read *[Dehumanized Data Points](https://medium.com/@mpierredavis/dehumanized-data-points-f32423311a40)*. 
* What's the central claim this author makes?
* Pick one example from Chapter 4 of Data Feminism. In what way(s) would this author argue that the example dehumanized people through data?

**Part 3:** Read *[Dehumanization in Medicine: Causes, Solutions, and Functions](https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edsfra&AN=edsfra.25778882&site=eds-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s8895369)*.
* In the process of developing ML models for healthcare contexts, are we at risk of dehumanizing patients? Which of the six causes identified by the author are applicable to us (and why). Are there causes that are applicable to us that aren't mentioned?
* Read *[Words, Do No Harm](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/articles/2023/05/words-do-no-harm)*. What are the ways in which dehumanizing language can affect patient care? 
* Is there language we use when talking about ML that's implicitly dehumanizing?

## Is data neutral?


````{admonition} Exercise: Data Neutrality 
**Part 1:** From the book, *[Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men](https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,sso&db=nlebk&AN=2030243&authtype=shib&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s8895369)*, read *Chapter 10: The Drugs Don't Work*. Then answer the following questions:
* What factors lead to the exlusion of female health data?
* What are the consequences of excluding female participants from medical research?
* Given what you read, are there any other groups of people you now suspect are excluded from medical research? What makes you suspect this? 
* What can you, as an individual, do to address the problems presented in the chapter?
* What can we, as a society, do to address the problems presented in the chapter?

**Part 2:** Read *[Data is never a raw, truthful input â€“ and it is never neutral](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/21/catherine-dignazio-data-is-never-a-raw-truthful-input-and-it-is-never-neutral)*.
* When the author says "data is never neutral," what do they mean?
* What are "who questions"? Why does the author advocate for using them?
* Whose responsbility is it to ask the "who questions"? The person who funds the research? The researcher who collected the data? The data scientist who analyzed it?
