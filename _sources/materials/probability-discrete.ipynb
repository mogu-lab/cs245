    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:** As your first assignment at IHH's ML team, you've been tasked with better understanding their Emergency Room (ER). Since you're new, you'd first like to better understand how the ER works at a high level. Specifically, you'd like to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Q1: How many beings come to ER every day?\n",
    "* Q2: Overall, what conditions do the beings come to the ER for? (e.g. inflamed antenna, fever, etc.)\n",
    "* Q3: How many being remain hospitalized over night?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** The answer to both of these questions cannot be given by a single number (e.g. the number of beings that come to the ER changes from day to day). So how can we give a deterministic answer to a question whose response is inherently variable or *stochastic*? Answer: *probability distributions*. Probability distributions are the basic building block that we will use to build complex ML systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Outline:** \n",
    "1. Introduce and practice the concepts, terminology, and notation behind discrete probability distributions (continuous distributions will be covered next).\n",
    "2. Answer the above questions using this new toolset.\n",
    "3. Start to gain familiarity with two important Python libraries we will use throughout the semester: `Jax` and `NumPyro`."

    "## Terminology and Notation for Discrete Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the spirit of all Computer Science classes, if we want the help of a computer to solve a problem, we need a *language* to precisely specify what we want it to do. Today, we will introduce the language---terminology and notation---from statistics, and we will then translate it into code that a computer can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The terminology that we introduce here is slightly different from ones that you may have seen in a statistics class. The reason for this is that we're honing in on the minimal subset of terminology we need to describe a probabilistic ML model."

    "**Random Variable (RV):** A variable whose possible values are outcomes of a random phenomenon.\n",
    "> Example: Let $N$ be an RV describing the number of beings that come into the ER on a given day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample:** A sample is a particular observation of the random phenomenon.\n",
    "> Example: On Monday, we observed $N = 30$ (on Tuesday, this number will be different).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Space or Support:** The set of all possible values that an RV can take on. For discrete probability, this set must be countable (though this is not important for now).\n",
    "> Example: The sample space for $N$ is the set $S = [0, \\infty)$, since we can have any number from $0$ to $\\infty$ (theoretically speaking) of beings come to the ER. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Mass Function (PMF):** A function mapping the outcome of an RV to the probability with which it occurs. We can write the PMF as a mapping from the sample space to a number on the unit interval: $p: S \\rightarrow [0, 1]$.\n",
    "> Example: Let $p_N(\\cdot)$ denote the PMF of $N$, where the dot represents an argument we have not specified. We denote the probability that $N$ takes on a specific value $n$ as follows: $p_N(n)$. If we were told that $p_N(5) = 0.1$, this means that the probability that exactly 5 beings came to the ER is 0.1 (or 10%).\n",
    "\n",
    "PMFs has one notable property: the probability of all outcomes in the sample space must sum to 1.\n",
    "> Example: Continuing with the above example, we have that $\\sum\\limits_{n \\in [0, \\infty)} p_N(n) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Independent, Identically Distributed (i.i.d):** We say a variable is i.i.d if different observations of the same phenomenon are independent (i.e. that do not affect one another) and if they follow the same PMF. For example, when we flip a coin, previous flips do not affect future flips (i.e. if the coin landed heads, it does not affect its probability of landing heads next), and every time we flip the coin, the probability of it landing heads is the same (so it's identically distributed).\n",
    "> Example: We the notation $N \\sim p_N(\\cdot)$ signifies that, the number of beings coming to the ER is distributed according to distribution $p_N(\\cdot)$, and that $N$ is sampled i.i.d.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary of Notation:** \n",
    "* Let $R$ denote an RV.\n",
    "* We denote the PMF of $R$ using $p_R(\\cdot)$. Note that $p_R(\\cdot)$ is a function that maps possible values $R$ can take on to probabilities (between 0 and 1).\n",
    "* We call $p_R(r)$ the evaluation of the function at $r$: i.e. what's the probability that $R$ equals the specific value $r$?\n",
    "* We write $R \\sim p_R(\\cdot)$ to denote that $R$ is sampled i.i.d from $p_R(\\cdot)$."
