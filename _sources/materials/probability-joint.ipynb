    "**Context:** So far, you've spent some time conducting a preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) of IHH's ER data. You noticed that considering variables separately can result in misleading information. As a result, you decided to use *conditional distributions* to model the *relationship between variables*. Using these conditional distributions, you were able to develop *predictive models* (e.g. predicting the probability of intoxication given the day of the week), These predictive models are useful for the IHH administration to make decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, you've noticed that your modeling toolkit is still limited. The conditional distributions we introduced can model how the probability of one variable changes given a *set* of variables. What if we wanted to describe how the probability of a *set* of variables (i.e. more than one) changes given a *set* of variables? For example, we may want to answer questions like: \"how does the probability that a patient is hospitalized for an allergic reaction change given the day of the week?\". In this question, we're asking a question about two variables---that the condition is an allergic reaction, *and* that the patient was hospitalized---given the day of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** We need to expand our modeling toolkit to include yet another tool---joint probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Outline:**\n",
    "1. Introduce and practice the concepts, terminology, and notation behind discrete joint probability distributions (leaving continuous distributions to a later time).\n",
    "2. Introduce a graphical representation to describe joint distributions.\n",
    "3. Translate this graphical representation directly into code in a probabilistic programming language (using `NumPyro`) that we can then use to fit the data.\n",
