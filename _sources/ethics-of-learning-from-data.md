# The Ethics of Learning from Data


## What does ML learn from data?

````{admonition} Exercise: Generalizability of ML Systems.
Read *[The myth of generalisability in clinical research and machine learning in health care](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7444947/pdf/main.pdf)*.
* What is generalizability? And what are the different "levels" of generalizability?
* Why might an ML system struggle to generalize? (Hint: see green panel). 
* In science, why do we value generalizability?
* What's the argument in favor of geographic generalizability?
* What's the argument against geographic generalizability?
* Do you consider generalizability a component of fairness when evaluating ML systems? Why or why not?

## Is science "objective"? 

````{admonition} Exercise: Objectivity of Science
**Part 1:** Read *[5 things journalists should know about statistical significance in research](https://journalistsresource.org/home/statistical-significance-research-5-things/)*.
* What is statistical significance testing? 
* What are p-values? 
* What are the scientific criticisms against statistical significance testing?
* Given that there are so many criticisms of p-values, why do scientists keep using this?
* How do you think statistical significance testing has been shaping science? Think of: What types of scientific discoveries gain public visibility? What kinds of scientific questions are more likely to be studied and to get funded? What kind of scientists get rewarded with more power and influence? 

**Part 2:** Read, *[Unpacking the flawed science cited in the Texas abortion pill ruling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/04/13/abortion-pill-safety/)*.
* What was scientifically flawed about the arguments made by the plaintiff?
* Science is based on individuals posing hypotheses they believe are likely to be true. For example, in this article, scientific arguments were made in support on both sides of a legal case. What does this reflect on our scientific ethos, that science is a method to objectively investigate the world?
* Reflecting on your own identity, values, and lived experience, where do you think your own biases might creep into your scientific process? 
* If you wanted to use science for important social decisions, how can you do it responsibly?

## Are data-driven systems "objective"?

````{admonition} Exercise: Objectivity of ML Systems
**Part 1:** Read [Great promise but potential for peril](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/10/ethical-concerns-mount-as-ai-takes-bigger-decision-making-role/).
* In the article, Sandel says AI "confers [...] scientific objectivity." What do they mean? 
* In your opinion, how does AI obtain scientific credibility?
