    "**Context:** At this point, you have the building blocks for developing many commonly-used ML models. Using these building blocks, we will develop a commonly used ML model---regression. A regression model is a *predictive* model (i.e. a conditional distribution), in which the variable we're interested in predicting is *continuous*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** Recall that in a conditional distribution, the parameters of the distribution depend on what we're conditioning. For example, when predicting the probability of intorixaction, $I$, given the day of the week, $D$, we can use a model like,\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p_{I | D}(i | d) = \\mathrm{Ber}(\\rho(d)) = \\underbrace{\\rho(d)^{i} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\rho(d) \\right)^{1 - i}}_{\\text{Bernoulli PMF (see Wikipedia)}},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where the parameter, $\\rho(d)$, is a function of the condition (i.e. the day $d$):\n",
    "\\begin{align} \\rho(d) &= \\begin{cases}\n",
    "0.1 & \\text{if $d$ is weekday} \\\\\n",
    "0.4 & \\text{if $d$ is weekend}\n",
    "\\end{cases} \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "As in this model, in all models we've considered so far, the parameters depend on the condition using if-else expressions (e.g. if $d$ is a weekday, then $\\rho = 0.1$, else $\\rho = 0.4$). Unfortunately, as models become more complex, this approach for specifying a model becomes unwieldy. For example, if instead of conditioning on something simple, like the day, we instead conditioned on something complicated, like medical image---$1000 \\times 1000$ pixels in size---how would we write the appropriate if-else expression? Out of a total of 1-million pixels in the image, which ones are important to even include in the if-else expression? The classes of predictive models we will introduce now---regression and (later) classification---precisely allow us to circumvent this issue.\n",
