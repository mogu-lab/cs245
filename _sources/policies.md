## Grades

Course grades are computed by weighing course components as follows:
* Homeworks: $70\%$
* In-class participation: $15\%$
* Team work: $15\%$

Course grade percentages are converted to letters via the table below:

| **Percentage** | **Letter Grade** |
|---|---|
| $\geq 93.3\%$ | A |
| $\geq 90.0\%$ | A- |
| $\geq 86.6\%$ | B+ |
| $\geq 83.3\%$ | B |
| $\geq 80.0\%$ | B- |
| $\geq 76.6\%$ | C+ |
| $\geq 73.3\%$ | C |
| $\geq 70.0\%$ | C- |
| $\geq 60.0\%$ | D |
| $< 60.0\%$ | F |


In case the average grade in the class is lower than expected, we may raise everyone's grades. We will **never** lower grades.

Recall that the minimum grade to earn credit under credit/no credit grading is C. The minimum grade to pass and earn credit under normal letter grading is D.

## Accessibility and Disability

**Disability Services.** Every student has a right to full access in this course. If you need any accommodations for CS 349, please contact Wellesleyâ€™s Disability Services. You should request accommodations **as early as possible**, since some situations can require significant time for accommodation design. If you need immediate accommodations, please arrange an appointment with the course instructor as soon as possible.

**Unsure about your need for accomodations?** If you are unsure but suspect you may have an undocumented need for accommodations, you are encouraged to contact Disability Services. They can provide assistance including screening and referral for assessments. Disability Services can be reached at `disabilityservices@wellesley.edu`, at `781-283-2434`, or by [scheduling an appointment online](https://www.wellesley.edu/disability).



## Religious Observance

Students whose religious observances conflict with scheduled course events should contact the instructors **in advance** to discuss alternative arrangements. You may do this through the [Wellesley College Religious Observance Notification System](https://webapps.wellesley.edu/religious_calendar/) if you prefer.



## Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct

Wellesley College considers diversity essential to educational excellence, and we are committed to being a community in which each member thrives. The College does not allow discrimination or harassment based on race, color, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, ethnic or national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, pregnancy or any other protected status under applicable local, state or federal law.
