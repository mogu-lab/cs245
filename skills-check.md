# Skills Check

This course assumes knowledge of the topics and skills below. Although you may not have experience with every single one of these, we expect that by satisfying the prerequisites, you can self-learn whatever you're missing prior to the start of the course. Please take a moment to review the topics below.


## Coding

**Programming Language.** The course is taught entirely in Python. To get the most out of the course, it's important you don't feel bogged down by too many syntax errors and the like so that you can focus on the concepts we introduce. If you do not feel comfortable with Python, that's no problem. Please do take the time before the start of the course to *study and practice* it. Here are some guides we recommend:


TODO:
* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib


## Math

TODO:
* sums and products
* logs
* derivatives (univariate)
* integrals (univariate)
* limits


## Probability and Statistics 

Although the course introduces a *probabilistic* paradigm of ML, we do not assume *any* prior knowledge of probability and statistics. All necessary topics from these subjects will be introduced as needed in the course.
