# Skills Check

This course assumes knowledge of the topics and skills listed below. Although you may not have experience with every single one of these, we expect that by satisfying the prerequisites, you can self-learn whatever you're missing prior to the start of the course. Please take a moment to review the topics below.


## Coding

**Programming Language.** The course is taught entirely in Python. To get the most out of the course, it's important you don't feel bogged down by too many syntax errors and the like so that you can focus on the concepts we introduce. If you do not feel comfortable with Python, that's no problem. Please do take the time before the start of the course to *study and practice* it. For review, we recommend:
* Going through an online Python tutorial. For example, from this [interactive Python tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/), review all sections under "Learn the Basics" and "Data Science Tutorials." From the "Advanced Tutorials," review "List Comprehensions" and "Lambda functions."
* After completing the tutorial, select one or two assignments from CS230 and translate them into Python.


**Coding Environment.** We will be using [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/) for all assignments in the course. DeepNote is an interactive Python environment that makes it easy to write code in small pieces, and to visualize and inspect them. Further, it let's you interleave your code with notes and math. If you're familiar with Jupyter notebooks, they are just a cloud version of a Jupyter notebook. If this is new to you, no problem! To get you started, we recommend:
* Making an account on the [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/) website using your Wellesley email and exploring.
* Watching/reading some online tutorials, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW4lKlUnLGU).
* Finally try making cells that run code and ones for writing text and math. Follow [this guide](https://gtribello.github.io/mathNET/assets/notebook-writing.html) for formatting text and for writing mathematical notation---we will use this heavily in the course!
  * The language used for formatting is called "markdown." You can find a markdown cheatsheet [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
  * The language used for typesetting mathematical notation is called LaTeX (pronounced "la-tek"). If you ever forget what's the syntax for a certain math symbol, you can draw it in [this tool](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) and it will tell you.


**Libraries.** We will regularly use two Python libraries throughout the course: `pandas`, used for reading in `.csv` data files and manipulating them, and `matplotlib`, used for visualizations.
* To learn `pandas`, you can find lots of tutorials online. For example you may find the first two lessons from [this tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) helpful.
* Similarly, [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_getting_started.asp) will walk you through how to use `matplotlib`.



## Math

**Notation.** We will be using the notation for sums and products heavily throughout the course:
\begin{align*}
\sum\limits_{n=1}^N f(x_n) &= f(x_1) + f(x_2) + \dots + f(x_N) \\
\prod\limits_{n=1}^N f(x_n) &= f(x_1) \cdot f(x_2) \cdots f(x_N) 
\end{align*}

**Rules of Logarithms.** We will rely on the following:
\begin{align*}
\log (x \cdot y) &= \log x + \log y \\
\log x^y &= y \cdot \log x
\end{align*}

**Univariate Calculus.** Derivatives, integrals, and limits (all in 1-dimension) will appear in some of the derivations. We will not ask you to do these by hand, but we expect you to know what they mean, conceptually and intuitively. To review these concepts, we recommend:
* TODO

**Probability and Statistics.** Although the course introduces a *probabilistic* paradigm of ML, we do not assume *any* prior knowledge of probability and statistics. All necessary topics from these subjects will be introduced as needed in the course.
