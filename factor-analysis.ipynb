    "**Context:** As we found in the chapter on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), our data might contain latent structure. In the IHH context, for example, each patient can be described by some underlying condition that explains their data, where there's a fixed number of possible conditions. However, what happens if the hidden structure is not discrete, but is continuous. By this, we mean that, instead of supposing there exists a discrete number of latent underlying patient conditions, there may be a *spectrum* of underlying conditions. Every patient lies somewhere on this spectrum, and our goal uncover it. \n",

Second, we'll need some efficient computational scheme to apply the law of total probability in practice.\n",
