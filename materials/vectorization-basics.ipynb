    "# An Introduction to \"Vectorization\" in `Jax`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is `Jax`?** `Jax` is a Python library for high-performance numerical computing and array operations capable of automatically run on different hardware (e.g. it can run on Graphical Processing Units---or GPUs---which are commonly used for training ML models). The main part of `Jax` you'll be interacting with (for now) comes from:"

    "This portion of `Jax` introduces its main building block: multi-dimensional arrays. Unlike other similar libraries that offer similar array-based framework (e.g. `NumPy`), `Jax` has some features that will make it possible for us to efficiently build and train ML models. Specifically, it will allow us to easily and accurately (no approximations!) compute gradients of functions written in `Jax` calls, which will become useful for training models (though more on that at a much later part of the course).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Array operations: the building blocks behind ML code.** You may be wondering, why do we need arrays for ML? This is because, as you will see throughout this course, all of the code we will write can be conveniently expressed in terms of array operations. `Jax` will make these fast for us so we can spend more time thinking and less time waiting for your code to run. It's therefore important that we re-learn how to *think* and how to *write* algorithms in terms of array operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectorization: a paradigm shift.** Vanilla Python code is slow, and for many practical purposes, that's not a problem. For training ML models, however, it does become a problem. Unlike in previous classes you may have taken, where you were encouraged to write loops, if/else-expressions, and more, in `Jax` we'll take a different paradigm: we will avoid writing loops and if/else-expressions. By this, don't mean that you completely let go of all your previous coding knowledge. It will come in handy when reading in data, creating visualizations, etc. But for the compute-heavy part of your code, we will rely on `Jax` library calls to do the work for us. This practice---of avoiding writing loops and if/else-expressions in the compute-heavy part of the code---is known as *vectorization*. Vectorization in `Jax` is implemented to be very, very fast under the hood.\n",

    "**Outline:**\n",

    "## Tips and Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading Documentation.** `Jax` was built to imitate another popular library, `NumPy`. Just about all functions implemented in `NumPy` have a corresponding `Jax` version with the same interface. Often, you'll find the internet has more resources on `NumPy` than on `Jax` (since `Jax` is newer) -- that's ok! The same tips often translate. Moreover, you may consider purposely looking up `NumPy` documentation to answer your questions because they often have *examples* (which the `Jax` documentation usually does not have). \n",
    "* You can find `jax.numpy` documentation [here](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.numpy.html).\n",
    "* You can find `numpy` documentation [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.math.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution: do NOT mix up `NumPy` arrays with `Jax` arrays.** You can technically call `Jax` functions on `NumPy` arrays and vice versa. PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT. Doing so will not throw any errors, but may result in other bugs that are difficult to find. One way you can keep yourself from making this mistake is: do not import `NumPy` at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Unlike `NumPy` arrays, `Jax` are immutable.** By this, we mean that once created, they cannot be altered. Any operation you perform on a `Jax` array will return a brand new array. For example, in `Numpy` you can set the 0th index of an array equal to some value with `arr[0] = value`, but in `Jax`, this will throw an error. You might think: this seems really inefficient---does this mean we are constantly burdening our computer by requesting for memory? `Jax` actually leverages this property to speed things up (this is not something we'll cover in the class). We note this property here because it's important to be aware of it! *Any operation you perform on a `Jax` array needs to be saved into a new variable.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**When unsure, play!** Whenever you find yourself unsure of how something works, or confused by all the jargon in the documentation, that's totally normal. To gain intuition, we recommend you tinker and play: try out little bits of code on small arrays in a controlled setting and see what happens. "
