    "\n",
    "**Context:** You've already spent some time conducting a preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) of IHH's ER data. You noticed that considering variables separately can result in misleading information. As such, today you will continue your EDA, this time also considering the *relationship between variables*. For example, you may want to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are there certain conditions that are more likely to occur on certain days?\n",
    "* What makes a patient likely to need hospitalization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** So far, however, we've only seen ways of characterizing the variability/stochasticity of a univariate random phenomenon independently of other variables. So how can we consider the relationship between variables? Answer: conditional probability. \n",
