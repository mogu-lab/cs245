    "## Differences Between Continuous and Discrete Probability\n",

    "Continuous probability functions the same way as discrete probability, except for a few key differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Space of Support:** The support of continuous probability distributions is over \"uncountably infinite sets.\" If you're not familiar with this term, that's ok! In this course, we'll think about it more as a distribution supported over the real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$ (or some subset thereof). \n",
    "> Example: Let $H$ be a continuous RV, describing the distribution of heights in the IHH ER. The support of $H$ is the interval $(0, \\infty)$ on the real line. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Mass Function (PMF):** Continuous probability distributions *DO NOT have PMFs*; this is because, unlike discrete distributions, we cannot think of continuous distributions in terms of frequency. Let's illustrate this with an example.\n",
    "> Example: Suppose we are modeling the probability of intoxication as a Bernoulli RV, $I$. If we say that the probability of intoxication (or $I=1$) is $0.5$ (meaning $p_I(1) = 0.5$), meaning half of our patients will have intoxication. Such a statement about the PMF of a discrete distribution can be immediately translated into intuition about frequency. On the other hand, suppose we have a continuous RV, $H$, modeling the height of patients. How can we describe the probability that a patient is 50 inches tall (i.e. what is $p_H(50)$?). Let's try to get some intuition. Of the patients in the data, maybe we have one that's $50.1$ inches tall, another that is $49.9$, or maybe one that's $49.999991$ inches tall---but what are the chances we will observe a patient that is *exactly* (not approximately) $50$ inches tall? The answer is: zero. This is because of the arbitrary precision we have on continuous values. So if we can't describe continuous distributions using PMFs, how else can we describe them? As you will see next, we will have to use a more circuitous route. "
