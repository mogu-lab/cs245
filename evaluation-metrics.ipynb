    "**Context:** At this point, we have a general framework for developing probabilistic models, as well as one way of fitting them to data, MLE. We've then instantiated this framework to develop two types of predictive models---regression and classification. We further learned how to build in expressivity using tools from deep learning---namely, neural networks---into these models. Are we finally ready to apply these models to real-life tasks? \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there's one key piece we're still missing: so far, we've only used 1- and 2-dimensional input data and 1-dimensional output data. While in principle, we already have the tools to implement predictive models for higher dimensional data, we don't yet have the tools to *evaluate* them. We've purposefully worked with lower dimensional data because it is easy to visualize, and therefore easy to qualitatively evaluate. But as data becomes higher dimensional, it's much more difficult to get intuition using visualizations. As a result, we will have to rely on *metrics*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** There are many ways of measuring model performance. Which metrics should we use? What are the pros and cons of each metric? We will answer these questions here. Even though our motivation for developing evaluation metrics is our inability to visualize high-dimensional data, we will in fact focus on low-dimensional data, again. This is because we need to gain intuition about each metric we introduce. \n",

    "**Decomposition into Sigal vs. Noise.** In probabilistic models, we often term one part of the model the \"trend\" or the \"signal,\" and we term the rest \"noise\" or \"observation error.\" For example, recall that in regression, our trend is captured by a function of the inputs, $\\mu(\\cdot; W)$, around which we assume a Gaussian observation error. Similarly, in the classification model we introduced, our trend is captured by a function of the inputs, $\\rho(\\cdot; W)$, which computes the probability of belonging to class 1 (as opposed to class 0). We then sample from a Bernoulli distribution with that probability---this represents the \"noise\" or \"observation error.\" When fitting a probabilistic model, we're always at risk of learning models that mix up what's signal vs. what's noise. This can happen in two ways: \n",
    "* **Overfitting:** When the \"signal\" part of the model memorizes the \"noise\" part, and as a result, interpolates poorly. By *interpolation*, we mean, how well the model fits data points *near* our training data. \n",

If we have multiple factors to consider, how can we possibly design a metric that gives us a single ranking of models from best to worst? The answer is: we can't.
