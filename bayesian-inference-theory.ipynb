Given these options, perhaps we could devise some algorithm to select the one we would like to use on our downstream task, or find some way to *combine* them. Unfortunately, the learning algorithm we've use so far---the MLE---doesn't provide us with a way to do this. The MLE gives a *single* model. "

Remember that, especially for more expressive models, optimization tends to get stuck in local optima. What if we were to collect an *ensemble* of models, all fit with the MLE to data, but each optimized from a different random initialization? Because each model would get stuck in a different local optima, each *might* behave differently than the others away from the data.

So far, our approach has been finding the *single* model that maximizes the probability of our observed data: $\\theta^\\text{MLE} = \\log p(\\mathcal{D}; \\theta)$. But isn't what we're actually interested is the *distribution* of models given the data, $p(\\theta | \\mathcal{D})$? In other words, conditioned on the data we've observed so far, we want to know which models (represented by their parameters, $\\theta$) are likely to fit the data well. In this new paradigm, we hope that:\n",
