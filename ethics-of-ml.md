## What is the Eugenics Movement?

````{admonition} Exercise: Background on Eugenics
**Part 1:** Read, *[Eugenics and Scientific Racism](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Eugenics-and-Scientific-Racism)*.
* What was the goal of eugenics / scientific racism?
* What form did eugenics take in the US? In Nazi Germany?
* Who participated in the eugenics movement?

**Part 2:** From, *[The Mismeasure of Man](http://tankona.free.fr/gould1981.pdf)*, read "The allure of numbers" and "Masters of craniometry: Paul Broca and his school" from Chapter 3 (trigger warning: offensive, discriminatory language). 
* What's the "allure of numbers"?
* What does the author mean by "Science is rooted in creative interpretation"? Provide an example (of the "numbers," interpretation, and theory). 
* What were some of the things Francis Galton quantified? What are some fallacies of conclusions he might draw from his data?
* What's Craniometry? 
* What happened when Mall tried to replicate Bean's findings? 
* What were the fallacies of Broca's scientific methods?

**Part 3:** Reflection.

## The Birth of Modern Statistics


When reading about Craniometry in *The Mismeasure of Man*, it's hard not to wonder what was going on thorugh those scientists' minds. It feels like their science is more rooted in desparation than it is in the real world---desparation to justify to others their superiority as white, European, cis-male academics. And to do so in a way that is most "objective" by rooting their arguments in numbers and statistics. It's also hard not mock them for their ridiculous obsession with measuring and quantifying everything around them in hopes of arriving at some universal formulae. Finally, in viewing eugenics in this way, we may be tempted to dismiss eugenics as a "blip" in history---a period marked by un-scientific practices used to justify clearly incorrect beliefs (e.g. that intelligence can be measured from brain sizes, that there exists some ranking of humans). 

However, here, we argue that dismissing eugenics as bad science is irresponsible. As we will show noxt, eugenics has fundamentally shaped statistics, science, and policy for years to come.

## The Politics of ML

Many of the techniques introduced in this class were created by leaders of the eugenics movement. To name a few, the MLE was proposed by Fisher in *[On an Absolute Criterion for Fitting Frequency Curves](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2246266)*. Factor Analysis was proposed by Burt in *[Experimental Tests of General Intelligence](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1909.tb00197.x)*, and [refined by Spearman](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Charles-Spearman%2C-Cyril-Burt%2C-and-the-origins-of-Lovie-Lovie/b4f2fe99f093d7dce355b3a1aff15889b0e364c3). Linear regression was proposed by Fisher in *[The Goodness of Fit of Regression Formulae, and the Distribution of Regression Coefficients](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2341124)*. Correlation was proposed by Galton in *[Co-Relations and Their Measurement, Chiefly from Anthropometric Data](https://www.jstor.org/stable/114860)*.

## Science as a Human Endeavor




 It's important for us not just to study ongoing harms of the movement, but to consider whether we, as scientists, are fundementally different from the leaders of eugenics. Are we subject to the same types of biases and unscientific methods?
