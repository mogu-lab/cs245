# The Ethics of Learning from Data


## What does ML learn from data?

````{admonition} Exercise: Generalizability of ML Systems.
Read *[The myth of generalisability in clinical research and machine learning in health care](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7444947/pdf/main.pdf)*.
* What is generalizability? And what are the different "levels" of generalizability?
* Why might an ML system struggle to generalize? (Hint: see green panel). 
* In science, why do we value generalizability?
* What's the argument in favor of geographic generalizability?
* What's the argument against geographic generalizability?
* Do you consider generalizability a component of fairness when evaluating ML systems? Why or why not?

## Is science "objective"? 

````{admonition} Exercise: Objectivity of Science
**Part 1:** Read *[5 things journalists should know about statistical significance in research](https://journalistsresource.org/home/statistical-significance-research-5-things/)*.
* What is statistical significance testing? 
* What are p-values? 
* What are the scientific criticisms against statistical significance testing?
* P-values are a human-created tool that has made its way into scientific standards, which, like other standards, are debated and negotiated throughout time. How can such standards shape scientific discourse? Use p-values as an example and think of: What types of scientific discoveries gain public visibility? What kinds of scientific questions are more likely to be studied and to get funded? What kind of scientists get rewarded with more power and influence? 
* How can we tell if the standard used in ML are promoting good scientific practices? For example, should we use the MLE? 

**Part 2:** Read, *[Unpacking the flawed science cited in the Texas abortion pill ruling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/04/13/abortion-pill-safety/)*.
* What was scientifically flawed about the arguments made by the plaintiff?
* Science is based on individuals posing hypotheses they believe are likely to be true. For example, in this article, scientific arguments were made in support on both sides of a legal case. What does this reflect on our scientific ethos, that science is a method to objectively investigate the world?
* Reflecting on your own identity, values, and lived experience, where do you think your own biases might creep into your scientific process? 
* If you wanted to use science for important social decisions, how can you do it responsibly?
